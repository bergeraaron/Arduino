int val = 0; //value for storing moisture value 
int soilPin = 26;//Declare a variable for the soil moisture sensor 
int soilPower = 17;//Variable for Soil moisture Power

//Rather than powering the sensor through the 3.3V or 5V pins, 
//we'll use a digital pin to power the sensor. This will 
//prevent corrosion of the sensor as it sits in the soil. 

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(115200);   // open serial over USB

  pinMode(soilPower, OUTPUT);//Set D7 as an OUTPUT
  digitalWrite(soilPower, LOW);//Set to LOW so no power is flowing through the sensor
}

void loop() 
{
Serial.print("Soil Moisture = ");    
//get soil moisture value from the function below and print it
Serial.println(readSoil());

//This 1 second timefrme is used so you can test the sensor and see it change in real-time.
//For in-plant applications, you will want to take readings much less frequently.
delay(1800000);//take a reading every second
}
//This is a function used to get the soil moisture content
int readSoil()
{

    digitalWrite(soilPower, HIGH);//turn D7 "On"
    delay(10);//wait 10 milliseconds 
    val = analogRead(soilPin);//Read the SIG value form sensor 
    digitalWrite(soilPower, LOW);//turn D7 "Off"
    return val;//send current moisture value
}
